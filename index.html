                <div class="h-50"></div>
                <p>My name is Andrea (she/her), and I am a Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC) offering Telehealth therapy in
                Connecticut. I aim to bring empathy, compassion, curiosity, authenticity, openness, laughter, and a love of human beings
                to my work. I’m on an endless journey of learning and will bring the whole of my life experience to our sessions. I want
                to walk with you in this part of your life journey and, together, gain a deeper understanding of who you are and how you
                can best heal.</p>
                <p>I was born in Toronto, Canada, and began my studies in life sciences at Queen’s University, which led to my early career
                in the business world. I’ve also lived in England and now in Connecticut. Learning has been a core theme throughout my
                life. As a mother of four, I went back to school to get an M.A. in Counseling from Northwestern University and, before that, an M.A.
                in Psychology from Southern Connecticut State University. Before opening my own practice, I worked (and still work) as a
                Licensed Clinician and Clinical Supervisor at Shoreline Wellness Center in West Haven and as a Clinician at the Post
                Traumatic Stress Center in New Haven.</p>

                            <h4>Nobody is Born Bad</h4>
                            <p>I believe that we are all born with beauty, grace, and a unique identity that, when nurtured and loved, has a chance to
                            grow and become. For many of us, growing up was harsh and even traumatic, and we naturally formed a blueprint for how to
                            live and survive. As life goes on, that blueprint can feel constraining, and our unhealed core experiences may leave us
                            with pain and shame. Shame tends to hide in the darkness, and deep pain can feel intractable.</p>
                            <p>Even when we are satisfied with our journey and approach to living, life inevitably brings difficult crossroads and
                            transitions–some with incalculable shock, pain, and loss. At other times, we may feel confused and disconnected from our
                            best selves and experience our lives and feelings through a muted lens. Peace, balance, love, and joy seem out of reach.</p>
                        </div>

                            <h4>We Are Made up of Many Parts</h4>
                            <p>My approach is informed by the Internal Family Systems (IFS) model, which suggests that we are made up of many distinct
                            and often opposing parts or aspects of ourselves. At any given moment, one or more of our parts is struggling for our
                            best interest, trying to keep our ‘system’ functioning smoothly and our pain minimized. Although our intentions are
                            good, our behaviors may seem counterintuitive, and their repercussions can be deeply painful and even disastrous. In
                            therapy, together we can learn about all of you, all your parts, how they work together, how they don’t, how they try to
                            help you function, how they seem dysfunctional, and, most importantly, how you can become the healer of you and find
                            harmony within.</p>

                            <p>Through the process of counseling, you will be able to grow so that your past wounds and hurts, recent life injuries, or
                            imbalances no longer hinder you from living your most authentic life. At your own pace, you can get to know and develop
                            trust in all parts of yourself. Together in therapy, we can bring your parts into the light, heal the pain, and help you
                            find balance, wholeness, and peace.</p>

                    <h3>How does telehealth therapy differ from in-person counseling?</h3>
                    <p>Many of my clients love telehealth therapy because of the convenience and flexibility. You can find the best therapist
                    for you with fewer travel, weather, childcare, or other constraints. However, I realize that telehealth therapy is not
                    for everyone. If you’re unsure, I encourage you to give it a try. It may feel different at first, but you just might
                    come to love the space and rhythm.</p>

                    LGBTQIA+ community, and/or belong to other minorities and are impacted by their intersecting marginalized identities.
                    Through therapy, I will witness your stories and learn about the ways your identities have informed your experiences.</p>

                            causes others to walk all over you. What underlies every one of these experiences is pain, and together we can change

                        <p>Through the process of counseling, you can get to a place where your past wounds and hurts are not driving you in
                            everyday life. At your own pace, you can develop trust in all parts of yourself. And when you are able to speak your
                            truth and be witness to the ways that your early experiences shaped who you are today, there can be an unburdening that
                            enables you to heal.</p>
