                <div class="h-50"></div>
                <p>My name is Andrea, and I am a Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC) located in New Haven, offering teletherapy to
                anyone in the state of Connecticut.</p>
                <p>I aim to bring empathy, sympathy, compassion, curiosity, authenticity, openness, laughter, and a love of human beings to
                each of my sessions. I’m on an endless journey of learning, so I’m not afraid to recognize when I’m wrong. I love being
                exposed to new frameworks and learning from my clients to gain a deeper understanding of their identities.</p>
                <!-- <p>I feel privileged to walk with my clients on their journey of healing, allowing it to unfold rather than positioning
                myself as an “expert” with tools to “fix” people. As a counselor, I ask myself, <i>what is my client hoping for in a deep
                and abiding sense?</i> Beyond developing strategies for managing anxiety, anger, or whatever it may be, <i>what do they really
                want?</i> Maintaining genuine hope for my clients is imperative, especially when they lose a sense of hope for themselves.</p> -->
                <p>Learning has been a core theme throughout my life. As a mother of four, I went back to school to get an M.A. in
                Counseling from Northwestern University and an M.A. in Psychology from Southern Connecticut State University. Before
                opening my own practice, I worked as a Licensed Clinician and Clinical Supervisor at Shoreline Wellness Center in West
                Haven and as a Clinician at the Post Traumatic Stress Center in New Haven.</p>

                            <h4>Nobody is Born Bad</h4>
                            <p>I believe that nobody is born bad. Instead, we are born with certain tendencies, and the ways we are treated as children
                                form a blueprint for how we live our lives. The problem is that this blueprint that we develop for survival continues
                                with us as we grow older and often stops fitting into the world we know.</p>
                            <p>It’s easier to understand why someone might develop PTSD after witnessing a terrible event, but relational/attachment
                                trauma, which develops as a child is growing up, is much more insidious and shapes who that child becomes. Having a
                                loving, attentive caregiver, whether it be a parent, grandparent, aunt/uncle, or family friend, is essential for
                                developing healthy attachment, yet so many of us are not afforded that experience.</p>
                            <p>The pain that we experience as children doesn’t magically disappear but is encoded into memory and often left unhealed.
                                Shame is amazing at hiding in the darkness, and it is my job as a counselor to help bring those innermost, hidden pains
                                to the light so that they can be healed. And when one part of the system heals, the whole system can begin healing too.</p>

                            <p>My approach is informed by the Internal Family Systems (IFS) model, which suggests that your system is made up of many
                            distinct, and often opposing, parts. At any given moment, each part is struggling for your best interest, trying to keep
                            your system functioning smoothly by minimizing the pain. Although the intentions are good, the repercussions can be
                            deeply painful and even disastrous.</p>

                            <h4>Healing is Possible</h4>
                            <p>People come to therapy because they’re in pain. Maybe you’re feeling anxious and depressed, you’re having difficulty
                                controlling your anger, you can’t seem to get out of bed, your relationships are suffering, you’re exhausted from
                                constantly trying to change other people or situations, or you feel like there’s a defect in your character that
                                causes others to walk all over you. What underlies every one of these experiences is pain, and together we can change
                                that.</p>
                            <p>Through the process of counseling, you can get to a place where your past wounds and hurts are not driving you in
                                everyday life. At your own pace, you can develop trust in all parts of yourself. And when you are able to speak your
                                truth and be witness to the ways that your early experiences shaped who you are today, there can be an unburdening that
                                enables you to heal.</p>

                    <h3>How does teletherapy differ from in-person counseling?</h3>
                    <p>Many of my clients love teletherapy because they don’t have to rely on the unpredictability of public transportation or
                        they otherwise live too far away to commute. Some tell me that they find it easier to open up from the comfort of their
                        own home. However, I realize that teletherapy is not for everyone. If you’re unsure, I encourage you to give it a try.
                        It will feel different at first, but you just might adapt to the pace and rhythm.</p>

                    <h3>How will you relate to my experiences?</h3>
                    <p>I believe in naming things that can be barriers. I am a white, cisgender woman, so I don’t have the same experiences as
                        many of my clients who are people of color, members of the LGBTQ+ community, or belong to other minorities. I never
                        pretend to know something that I don’t, and if I ever get something wrong, please call me out.</p>

                                                <em>Many of my clients love teletherapy because they don’t have to rely on the unpredictability of public transportation or
                                                they otherwise live too far away to commute. Some tell me that they find it easier to open up from the comfort of their
                                                own home. However, I realize that teletherapy is not for everyone. If you’re unsure, I
                                                encourage you to give it a try. It will feel different at first, but you just might adapt to the pace and rhythm.</em>

                        <p>People come to therapy because they’re in pain. Maybe you’re feeling anxious and depressed, you’re having difficulty
                            controlling your anger, you can’t seem to get out of bed, your relationships are suffering, you’re exhausted from
                            constantly trying to change other people or situations, or you’re feeling like there’s a defect in your character that
                            causes others to walk all over you. What underlies every one of these experiences is pain, and together we can change
                            that.</p>
                        <p>Through the process of counseling, you can get to a place where your past wounds and hurts are not driving you in
                            everyday life. At your own pace, you can develop trust in all parts of yourself. And when you are able to speak your
                            truth and be witness to the ways that your early experiences shaped who you are today, there can be an unburdening that
                            enables you to heal.</p>
